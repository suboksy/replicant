Because the treatments are very old, they are from the 80s, believe it or not," Fernando Goldsztein said.Fernandos son, Frederico, was diagnosed with a brain tumor when he was nine years old. Medulloblastoma is the most common brain tumor in children, but it is still rare. Just five out of one million kids are diagnosed with the disease each year, which has made finding funding for new research difficult. "Unfortunately, he relapsed," Fernando said. "I was told by the doctors back then that there was nothing to do to save my son, that I should go back to home and spend time with him."

The results have been promising, and one participants cancer was nearly eliminated. In a separate study still being tested on mice, scientists at the University of Florida are researching an experimental mRNA-based cancer vaccine. The study could lead to a universal shot that helps jump-start a patients immune system when fighting cancer. Scientists in one MBI-funded clinical trial are programming white blood cells to seek out and destroy cancer cells.
